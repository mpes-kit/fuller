# Electronic band structure reconstruction and parametrization

## Introduction

This Python package comprises a set of tools to reconstruct and parametrize the electronic band structure (EBS) from
photoemission spectroscopy data. It implements the Markov Random Field model introduced in
[Xian & Stimper et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/) in TensorFlow. 


## Methods of installation

The latest version of the package can be installed via pip

```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/mpes-kit/fuller.git
```

Alternatively, download the repository and run

```
python setup.py install
```

### Requirements

Apart from the packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file, `tensorflow` is needed. Installation instructions can
be found at the [official webpage](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). The package works with the CPU only and GPU
supported version of the framework. Currently, only version TensorFlow 1 (1.14 onwards) is supported, but we are working
on porting it to TensorFlow 2.

## Sample dataset

As a model system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology we worked on 3D photoemission data of the
semiconductor tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>). It resolve the momentum along the x- and y- axis (k<sub>x</sub> and k<sub>y</sub>)
and the energy.

### Reconstruction

All 14 valence band of WSe<sub>2</sub> are visible in the dataset. The optimization was initialized by DFT calculation with [HSE06](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1564060) hybrid exchange-correlation functional. The results are shown in the
figure below.

### Preprocessing and Reconstruction

#### Class MrfRec

The `MrfRec` class is of central importance for reconstruction as well as preprocessing the data. To reconstruct the EBS
create a `MrfRec` object and use its methods to perform the algorithms and plot the results. Here, we list a selection
of the most important methods of the class. For further illustration on how to use the class check out the
`mpes_reconstruction_mrf.ipynb` notebook in the example folder.

##### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(E, kx=None, ky=None, I=None, E0=None, eta=0.1, includeCurv=False, etaCurv=0.1):
    ...
```

* `E`: Energy as numpy array
* `kx`: Momentum along x axis as numpy array, if `None` it is set to 0
* `ky`: Momentum along y axis as numpy array, if `None` it is set to 0
* `I`: Measured intensity wrt momentum (rows) and energy (columns), generated if `None`
* `E0`: Initial guess for band structure energy values, if `None` the median of `E` is taken
* `eta`: Standard deviation of neighbor interaction term
* `includeCurv`: Flag, if true curvature term is included during optimization
* `etaCurv`: Standard deviation of curvature term

##### iter_para

```python
def iter_para(num_epoch=1, updateLogP=False, use_gpu=True, disable_tqdm=False, graph_reset=False):
    ...
```

Hereby, the parallel optimization of Markov Random Field model can be performed to reconstruct an electronic
band.
* `num_epoch`: Number of epochs to perform
* `updateLogP`: Flag, if true logP is updated every half epoch (requires more computations)
* `use_gpu`: Flag, if true gpu is used for computations if available
* `disable_tqdm`: Flag, it true no progress bar is shown during optimization
* `graph_reset`: Flag, if true Tensorflow graph is reset after computation to reduce memory demand

##### normalizeI

```python
def normalizeI(kernel_size=None, n_bins=128, clip_limit=0.01, use_gpu=True, threshold=1e-6):
    ...
```

This performs Multidimensional Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (MCLAHE), introduced in
[Stimper et al. 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8895993). The method is a wrapper for the [TensorFlow
implementation of the `mclahe` function](https://github.com/VincentStimper/mclahe).
* `kernel_size`: Tuple of kernel sizes, 1/8 of dimension lengths of x if `None`
* `n_bins`: Number of bins to be used in the histogram
* `clip_limit`: Relative intensity limit to be ignored in the histogram equalization
* `use_gpu`: Flag, if true gpu is used for computations if available
* `threshold`: Threshold below which intensity values are set to zero
